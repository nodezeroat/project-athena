#slide(title: "Assembly Recap")[
  CPUs work with registers and memory

  x86-64 has many registers such as ` rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rdi, rsi, rsp, rip, r8-r15`

  Special registers:

  - `rip`: Current instruction pointer

  - `rsp`: Current stack pointer

  - `rbp`: Stack frame base pointer

  - `cr3`: Virtual memory selector for a process
]

#slide(title: "Assembly Recap")[
  We can access certain bits of registers individually:

  #image("./figures/multi-access-register.png")

  This allows for backwards compatability

  32-bit programs can just use `eax`
]

#slide(title: "Assembly Recap")[
  - Each thread has its own set of registers and dedicated stack memory
  - Registers are faster than memory
  - Registers are limited in size
  - Switch between threads:
    - CPU context switches
    - Exchange registers on the executing core
]

#slide(title: "Assembly Recap")[
  Instruction format:

  ```asm
  <instruction_mnemonic>  <destination>, <source>
  mov    rax,            rbx
  ```

  -> Means move rbx to rax

  -> The compiler turns assembly into actual opcodes

  ```asm
  mov rax, rbx``` => 0x48, 0x89, 0xd8

  Online (dis)assembler: https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm#disassembly
]

#slide(title: "Data Movement")[
  ```asm
  // Moves rbx into rax
  mov rax, rbx
  // Moves 0x4000 into rax
  mov rax, 0x4000
  // Moves the 8-byte value at the address of rbx into rax
  mov rax, [rbx]
  ```
  => rbx = 0x400000 `mov rax, [0x400000]`

  C equivalent:

  => `rax = *0x400000;`
]

#slide(title: "Arithmetics")[
  ```asm
  // Adds rbx to rax
  add rax, rbx
  // Substracts rbx from rax
  sub rax, rbx
  // ...
  xor rax, rbx
  // ...
  and rax, rbx
  ...
  ```
]

#slide(title: "Control Flow")[
  ```asm
  // Calls a function
  call function
  // Returns from a function to the next instruction
  ret
  ```
]

#slide(title: "Control Flow")[
  Example:

  ```asm
  call target
  // in target:
  => mov rax, 3
  => ret
  // back in caller:
  mov rbx, rax
  ```
  rbx = 3
]

#slide(title: "Control Flow")[
  ```asm
  // Always jump to address
  jmp address
  // Jump if not zero
  jnz address
  // Jump if equal
  je address
  // Jump if less or equal
  jle address
  ```
  => Based on EFLAGS (special registers)
]

#slide(title: "Control Flow")[
  ```asm
  cmp rax, rbx
  jle error
  ret
  ```

  Jump to error IF RAX \<= RBX

  Otherwise return from the function
]

#slide(title: "C to assembly")[
  ```c
  int x;
  x = 10;
  ```
  Becomes:
  ```asm
  mov rax, 10
  ```
  Not every C line is atomic in asm:

  x = x + 10;

  ```asm
  mov rbx, rax // temporary value
  add rbx, 10  // add 10
  mov rax, rbx // move temp back to x
  ```
