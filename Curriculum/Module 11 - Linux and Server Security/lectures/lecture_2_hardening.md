# Linux Hardening

## Why is Linux Server Hardening Important?

Anyone who runs computer infrastructure they rely upon should be concerned about hardening their systems. This is especially important where user data such as Personally Identifiable Information are involved.

There are different kinds of system hardening:

- Server hardening
- OS Hardening
- Application hardening

## Server hardening

Each layer and component of an system needs to be hardened to ensure that they provide a secure base for the next layer. This all starts with the hardware, the foundation of the application stack.

The idea is to make the server as robust as possible against local attacks, i.e. people with physical access to the machine, and prevent them from snooping on the data on the server or introducing malicious code.

### BIOS updates

Manufacturers frequently release new BIOS versions to address security issues, and it’s important to keep on top of these by updating to the latest version as soon as is reasonable.

### SecureBoot

This uses digital signatures to ensure that the system boots genuine signed code, and means that it is harder for an attacker with physical access to the server to subvert the boot process.

### Set BIOS passwords

 Features such as SecureBoot can be disabled in the BIOS, so it’s important to set a BIOS password to prevent that.

### Disable USB ports

If the server doesn’t need to use certain hardware features, these can often be disabled in the BIOS, to further prevent physical attacks against the system.

### Full disk encryption

Disk encryption means that someone can’t take the disks out of the machine and access or modify the contents offline. In cloud environments and virtual machines, disk encryption also prevents a malicious actor at the hypervisor level from accessing ones virtual disks.

## OS Hardening

The following topics aim to enhance the security of a server by implementing a series of measures aimed at reducing vulnerabilities and minimizing potential attack surfaces on an OS level:

### Bootloader (Grub)

To ensure that a user cannot change the kernel or distribution, it is recommended to change access to the bootloader config files. To completely thwart a boot into another OS on the computer, the bios should have a admin password set.

Steps for root for grub:

1. Set the owner and group of `/etc/grub.conf` and `/etc/grub.d` or in some cases `/etc/default/grub`.

	```bash
	chown root:root /etc/grub.conf
	chown -R root:root /etc/grub.d
	chown root:root /etc/default/grub
	```

2. Set permissions for `/etc/grub.conf` and `/etc/grub.d` or in some cases `/etc/default/grub`

	```bash
	chmod og-rwx /etc/grub.conf
	chmod -R or-rwx /etc/grub.d
	chown or-rwx /etc/default/grub
	```

### Linux Kernel

The heart of a linux distribution is the kernel, protecting it is absolutely necessary to ensure a hardened server. What now follows are configs to protect kernel logs and logs, the memory and enable ExecShield to protect the system from certain buffer overflow vulnerability and arbitrary code execution.

#### Kernel logs

Kernel logs are a crucial aspect of a machine administration. Logs can reveal information about the state of daemons, show warnings or other critical messages. The logs are split into eight log levels, starting at level 0 and decreasing in severity until level 7, which are debug logs. In order to protect these logs from unauthorized access, one can restrict the permissions of the logs with the following command:

Steps for root:

1. Restrict access to the kernel logs in the sysctl.d config files
	```bash
	echo "kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-dmesg-restrict.conf
	```

#### Kernel pointer

A kernel pointer is basically a way of exposing kernel address via /proc and other interfaces. By setting the kernel.kptr_restrict to 1, all kernel pointers are when printed, are replaced with 0s.

Steps for root:

1. Restrict access to the kernel pointers in the sysctl.d config files
	```bash
	echo "kernel.kptr_restrict = 1" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-kptr-restrict.conf
	```

#### Exec Shield

Exec Shield is a project that has its origins at Red Hat. It was developed in late 2002 with the aim of reducing the risk of worms or other automated remote attacks on Linux systems. It attempts to flag data memory as non-executable and program memory as non-writable, therefore suppressing many security exploits such as buffer overflows or other techniques relying on overwriting data and inserting code.

Steps for root:

1. Enable Exec Shield in the sysctl.d config files
	```bash
	echo "kernel.exec-shield = 2" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-exec-shield.conf
	```

#### Memory protection

The Linux kernel has a defense mechanism named address space layout randomization (ASLR), which is tuneable with the `randomize_va_space` setting. The main goal of this patch is to randomize memory segments to make abuse by malicious programs harder.

Steps for root:

1. Enable memory randomization in the sysctl.d config files
	```bash
	echo "kernel.randomize_va_space=2" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-rand-va-space.conf
	```

### Config SELinux

A incredibly crucial setting is to enforce the SELinux rules. SELinux stands for Security-Enhanced Linux and is a kernel security module. It has been integrated into various distributions but is set to only warn the user upon a rule violation.

Steps as root:

1. Change the `SELINUXTYPE`in`/etc/selinux/config`
 `SELINUXTYPE=enforcing`
2. Remove this line from `/etc/default/grub` if it exists
 `selinux=0`

### Network

To protect from potential risks in the network layer there are several settings to enhance the security of the system, like enabling TCP SYN Cookie protection, disabling IP source routing and ignoring broadcast requests.

#### TCP/SYN Cookie protection

The TCP SYN Cookie protection setting in Linux is a precaution against TCP SYN flood attacks that can cause a denial of service by overloading the system's TCP connection table. Using SYN cookies prevents connection from being tracked until an ACK is received.

Steps as root:

1. Enable TCP SYN Cookie protection
	```bash
	echo "net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-net-stack.conf
	```

#### Routing

Source routing is a IP mechanism that allows IP packets to carry a list of addresses that tells a router the path the packet must take. This allows the "source" to specify the route, ignoring the routing tables of other routers. It can allow a user to redirect network traffic for malicious purposes.

Steps as root:

1. Disable IP source routing
	```bash
	echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-net-stack.conf
	```

#### ICMP

By ignoring ICMP requests ones device cannot be found as easily, also hiding precious information. O ne should keep in mind that this setting will lead to a harder time debugging.

Steps as root:

1. Disable ICMP redirect acceptance
	```bash
	echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-net-stack.conf
	```
2. Enable ignoring to ICMP requests
	```bash
	echo "net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-net-stack.conf
	```

#### Broadcast

This setting deals with the IPv4 ICMP echo broadcasts. There messages are the messages used by the "ping" tool. By ignoring broadcast ICMP echo requests the machine won't respond when someone tried to ping a broadcast address to find all hosts on the network.

Steps as root:

1. Enable ignoring broadcast requests
	```bash
	echo "net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-net-stack.conf
	```

## Application hardening

When it comes to application security, it is more difficult to be prescriptive about hardening as each application has its own security requirements. However, there are general security and hardening principles that can be applied to most applications:

### Enforce strong encryption

For example, web-based applications use TLS, for which certificates can be provisioned through Let’s Encrypt.

### Principle of Least Privilege

For the best security practices, system privileges should only be granted to those who require them. A minimum access policy ensures that users have the lowest level of privileges to complete necessary functions.

### Configure logging, and monitor logs for anomalies

Application logs should be aggregated remotely to ensure that they can’t be altered or destroyed by an attacker, and the logs should be analysed to detect anomalous behaviour which could reveal the start of an active attack.

### Check dependencies for vulnerabilities

Most applications have a large number of software libraries and dependencies, any of which might have security vulnerabilities – all components need to be kept patched and up to date.
