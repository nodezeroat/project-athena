# Assignment: Comprehensive Web Security Lab Challenge

## Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to hone your hands-on skills in web security by engaging with real-world simulations. You will complete a series of labs from PortSwigger's Web Security Academy across multiple difficulty levels and categories, and draft comprehensive write-ups detailing your findings, approaches, and solutions. This assignment simulates real-world penetration testing scenarios and prepares you for professional security assessments.

## Instructions

### 1. **Selection of Labs:**

- Visit [PortSwigger's Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs).
- Complete **10 total labs** with the following requirements:
  - At least **10 PRACTITIONER level** (or higher)
- You must complete labs from **at least 5 different categories**.
- Begin each lab by thoroughly reading the provided instructions and understanding the objectives

### 2. **Lab Completion:**

- Navigate through each lab with the intent to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them as guided.
- Utilize the tools and techniques you've learned thus far, and ensure you take notes of your approach, challenges, and solutions for each lab.
- If you're stuck, it's okay to refer to the lab's solutions, but ensure you understand the provided solution before moving on.

### 3. **Write-up Compilation:**

For each lab you've completed, create a detailed write-up with the following structure:

**Required Sections:**

- **Introduction:** Briefly describe the lab, its difficulty level, category, and main objectives
- **Vulnerability Analysis:** Explain what vulnerability exists and why it's exploitable
- **Approach:** Detail the step-by-step process you used to exploit the vulnerability
- **Challenges Faced:** Discuss any hurdles or difficulties you encountered and how you overcame them
- **Impact Assessment:** What could an attacker achieve with this vulnerability in a real-world scenario?
- **Remediation:** How should this vulnerability be fixed? Provide specific recommendations
- **Conclusion:** Summarize the key learnings from the lab and any additional insights you gained

**Additional Requirements:**

- Include screenshots showing successful exploitation (flag capture or solved confirmation)
- Document the exact payloads or requests you used
- Reference relevant OWASP categories where applicable
- Ensure each write-up is clear, organized, and demonstrates your understanding of the lab's content

### 4. **Submission:**

- Combine all your write-ups into a single, well-organized document.
- Your document should include:
  - **Cover page** with your name, date, and assignment title
  - **Table of contents** with page numbers, organized by category or difficulty
  - **Executive summary** (1 page): Brief overview of labs completed, key skills demonstrated, and overall learning outcomes
  - **Lab write-ups** (main section): All 10 labs with complete documentation as specified above
  - **Reflection** (1-2 pages): Overall lessons learned, which challenges were most valuable, and areas for further study
  - **Appendix**: Complete list of labs with URLs and difficulty levels
- Organize labs by category or difficulty level (your choice)
- Expected length: 15-30 pages (quality over quantity)

## Submission Requirements

### Deliverables

1. **Comprehensive Lab Report (PDF)**:
   - Professional formatting with cover page and table of contents
   - All sections as outlined above
   - Screenshots embedded inline with explanations
   - Code blocks and payloads properly formatted
   - File naming: `Module04_Assignment1_[YourName].pdf`

### Format Requirements

- **Document**: PDF format, professional appearance
- **Code**: Syntax highlighted, properly formatted
- **Screenshots**: Clear, annotated with explanations
- **Submission**: Upload to Google Drive per course guidelines

## Bonus Points Task: Advanced EXPERT Lab Completion

### Objective

Earn bonus points by challenging yourself with advanced EXPERT-level labs. This task will demonstrate your ability to tackle higher complexity problems and deepen your practical understanding of web security.

### Requirements (up to 10 additional points)

Complete **5 additional EXPERT-level labs** from PortSwigger Web Security Academy:

- All 5 labs must be rated **EXPERT** difficulty
- Labs should be from **at least 3 different categories**
- Provide the same detailed write-ups as the main assignment
- Include additional analysis of the advanced techniques required

### Bonus Submission Guidelines

- Include these EXPERT lab write-ups in your report as a separate section titled **"Bonus: EXPERT Lab Challenges"**
- Follow the same write-up format as your main labs
- Clearly indicate the difficulty level and category for each bonus lab
- In your write-ups, specifically address:
  - What made this lab more complex than PRACTITIONER level?
  - What advanced techniques or tools were required?
  - How does this lab represent real-world attack scenarios?

### Bonus Evaluation Criteria

- **Lab Completion** (5 points): Successfully completed 5 EXPERT labs from 3+ categories
- **Write-up Quality** (3 points): Clear documentation of advanced techniques and complexity
- **Advanced Understanding** (2 points): Deep technical insight and professional analysis

## Tips for Success

### Strategy

1. **Start with easier labs**: Build confidence with APPRENTICE/PRACTITIONER before attempting EXPERT
2. **Progress gradually**: Move to higher difficulty as you gain skills
3. **Document immediately**: Take screenshots and notes as you solve each lab
4. **Understand, don't memorize**: Focus on understanding the vulnerability, not just solving the lab
5. **Use hints wisely**: PortSwigger provides hints; use them after genuine effort

### Technical Approach

1. **Read carefully**: Lab descriptions contain important clues
2. **Use Burp Suite**: Essential for intercepting and modifying requests
3. **Analyze responses**: Server responses often reveal vulnerabilities
4. **Try variations**: If one payload doesn't work, modify it
5. **Consult documentation**: PortSwigger provides excellent learning materials

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Copying solutions without understanding
- ❌ Skipping documentation until the end
- ❌ Only doing easy labs
- ❌ Not taking screenshots of successful exploitation
- ❌ Generic remediation recommendations without specifics

## Academic Integrity

### Allowed Resources

- ✅ PortSwigger Web Security Academy materials and hints
- ✅ Module 04 lecture notes and slides
- ✅ OWASP documentation and cheat sheets
- ✅ Official tool documentation (Burp Suite, etc.)
- ✅ Your own notes from lectures and previous assignments

### Not Allowed

- ❌ Copying writeups from other students
- ❌ Sharing solutions or flags with classmates
- ❌ Submitting AI-generated content without understanding
- ❌ Plagiarizing online writeups (learning from them is okay, copying is not)

**This is individual work. You must complete labs yourself and write your own analysis.**

### Citation Requirements

- Cite any resources used for learning (tutorials, documentation)
- If you consulted a hint or partial solution, acknowledge it
- Document all tools used

**Violations of academic integrity will result in a zero for the assignment and potential further consequences.**

## Important Notes

1. **Start Early**: This assignment requires significant time and effort
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Thorough documentation of 10 labs beats superficial coverage of 15
3. **Learn, Don't Just Complete**: The goal is mastery, not just collecting flags
4. **Bonus is Optional**: EXPERT labs are challenging; attempt them only after mastering PRACTITIONER level
5. **Ask Questions**: Use class hours if stuck (but don't ask for solutions)
6. **Professional Standards**: Write as if this is a real penetration testing report
