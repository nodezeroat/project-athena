    [
      *Hacker ethics* are moral values shaping how individuals in the cybersecurity community act.

      They emphasize:

      - Curiosity, creativity, and freedom of information
      - Responsible behavior in the digital world
      - A tradition originating in the 1960s/70s, codified by Steven Levy (1984)

      *Not about crime—about exploration and improving systems.*
    ],
  )
]

#section-slide(title: "Core Principles")

#slide(title: "Core Principles – Part 1")[
  1. *Information should be free*

    Open knowledge promotes innovation and transparency.

  2. *Unlimited access to learning tools*

    Hands-on exploration (*tinkering*) fosters understanding.

  3. *Mistrust authority – promote decentralization*

    Power should be distributed, not centralized.

  #alert("Inspired by hacker subcultures at MIT and beyond.")
]

#slide(title: "Core Principles – Part 2")[
  4. *Judge by skill, not status*

    Merit over formal credentials.

  5. *Code as art*

    Beauty in elegant solutions and creative hacks.

  6. *Computers can improve lives*

    #alert("Ethical use of tech to empower people and fix broken systems.")

    [Black Hat], [Personal gain], [Exploitation, theft],
  )

  #alert("Ethics are shaped not just by actions—but also by intent and context.")
]

#slide(title: "Dilemma 1: Vulnerability Disclosure")[
  *What should you do when you find a vulnerability?*

  - *Responsible disclosure:* Notify vendors, give time to fix
  - *Full disclosure:* Go public to pressure action
  - *Non-disclosure:* Risky but sometimes done

  #alert("⟶ Community norms favor responsible, coordinated disclosure.")
]

#slide(title: "Dilemma 2: Privacy vs. Security")[
  *How do we balance protection and freedom?*

  - Surveillance can prevent threats—but may violate privacy
  - Ethical hackers support:

    - Privacy-preserving tech (e.g., encryption)
    - Transparent oversight and accountability

  #alert(""Security" is not an excuse to erase rights.")
]

#slide(title: "Dilemma 3: Gray Hat Behavior")[
  **Is it okay to break rules for a good cause?**

  - Access without permission—then report flaws
  - Intention is good, but legality is unclear
  - Laws like the CFAA make this a risky path

  #alert("⚠️ Even good intentions can lead to legal consequences.")
]

#section-slide(title: "Conclusion")

#slide(title: "Conclusion")[
  Hacker ethics are about #alert("how") and #alert("why") we hack.

  They call for:

  - Curiosity, creativity, and responsibility
  - Openness and meritocracy
  - Continuous reflection and legal awareness

  #alert("Ethical hacking is about building a better, safer digital world.")
