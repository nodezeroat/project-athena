# Search Engines for Reconnaissance

Search engines have evolved far beyond simple web page indexing. Modern search engines—both traditional web search and specialized cybersecurity-focused platforms—provide powerful reconnaissance capabilities for discovering vulnerable devices, exposed data, network infrastructure, and sensitive information. This lecture explores how attackers and security professionals leverage search engines to map attack surfaces and identify security weaknesses without directly interacting with target systems.

## Traditional Search Engines for Reconnaissance

### Google Dorking (Google Hacking)

**Definition**: Using advanced Google search operators to find security-related information, vulnerabilities, and sensitive data indexed by Google's web crawlers.

**Why It Works**: Organizations often unintentionally expose sensitive information on public-facing web servers. Google's aggressive crawling indexes this data, making it searchable through specific query operators.

### Google Search Operators

#### Basic Operators

**site:** - Limit results to specific domain

```text
site:example.com
site:example.com -www
site:*.example.com
```

**filetype:** or **ext:** - Search for specific file types

```text
site:example.com filetype:pdf
site:example.com ext:xls
site:example.com (filetype:doc OR filetype:pdf OR filetype:xls)
```

**inurl:** - Search for terms in URL

```text
inurl:admin
inurl:login
inurl:config
site:example.com inurl:admin
```

**intitle:** - Search for terms in page title

```text
intitle:"index of"
intitle:"dashboard" inurl:admin
intitle:"Apache Status" "Apache Server Status for"
```

**intext:** - Search for terms in page body

```text
intext:"confidential" site:example.com
intext:"password" filetype:log
```

**cache:** - View Google's cached version of page

```text
cache:example.com
```

**link:** - Find pages linking to specific URL

```text
link:example.com
```

#### Advanced Combinations

**Exposed Directories**:

```text
intitle:"index of" "parent directory"
intitle:"index of" "backup"
intitle:"index of" ".git"
intitle:"index of" "database"
```

**Configuration Files**:

```text
site:example.com ext:conf OR ext:config OR ext:cfg
site:example.com inurl:web.config
filetype:env "DB_PASSWORD"
```

**Database Files**:

```text
filetype:sql "INSERT INTO" "VALUES"
filetype:sql "CREATE TABLE" intext:password
site:example.com ext:sql
```

**Credentials and Sensitive Data**:

```text
site:example.com intext:"password" filetype:xls
site:example.com filetype:txt "username" "password"
"index of" intext:credentials
filetype:log intext:password
```

**Server Information**:

```text
intitle:"Apache Status" "Server Version"
intitle:"IIS7" "Detailed Error"
intitle:"phpinfo()" "PHP Version"
```

**Vulnerable Applications**:

```text

site:example.com intitle:"index of"
```

#### **Phase 5: Login Portal Discovery**

```text
site:example.com inurl:login
site:example.com inurl:admin
site:example.com intitle:dashboard
```

### Other Traditional Search Engines

**Bing** - Microsoft's search engine with unique operators:

```text
ip:192.168.1.1
contains:pdf site:example.com
url:admin site:example.com
```

**DuckDuckGo** - Privacy-focused, less aggressive caching, useful for avoiding detection:

```text
site:example.com
filetype:pdf site:example.com
```

**Yandex** - Russian search engine, excellent image search (reverse image search often better than Google):

```text
site:example.com
```

## Shodan: Search Engine for Internet-Connected Devices

### What is Shodan?

**Shodan** is the world's first search engine for internet-connected devices. Unlike traditional search engines that index web page content, Shodan continuously scans the entire IPv4 address space and indexes information about services, devices, and systems directly connected to the internet.

**Created**: By John Matherly in 2009
**Purpose**: Originally for security research, now used by security professionals, researchers, and unfortunately, attackers

**What Shodan Indexes**:

- Web servers and their banners
- Industrial Control Systems (ICS/SCADA)
- Network devices (routers, switches, firewalls)
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices
- Databases exposed to the internet
- Webcams and surveillance systems
- Smart home devices
- Medical equipment
- Building management systems
- Power grid components

### How Shodan Works

1. **Scanning**: Shodan continuously scans common ports across all IPv4 addresses
2. **Banner Grabbing**: Captures service banners containing software versions, configurations
3. **Indexing**: Stores data in searchable database
4. **Categorization**: Tags devices by type, location, organization
5. **Vulnerability Matching**: Cross-references with known vulnerabilities

**Common Ports Scanned**:

- 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 23 (Telnet), 25 (SMTP)
- 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 8080, 8443 (HTTP alternates)
- 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL), 27017 (MongoDB)
- 1883 (MQTT), 502 (Modbus), 102 (S7)
- And hundreds more...

   ```

2. **Identify Exposed Services**:
   - Find services that shouldn't be public
   - Locate forgotten or shadow IT assets
   - Discover misconfigurations

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**:

   ```text
   org:"Your Organization" vuln:*
   ```

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up Shodan monitors for your IP ranges
   - Receive alerts when new services appear
   - Track changes over time

## Other Specialized Search Engines

### PublicWWW

**Purpose**: Search for specific code, scripts, or tracking IDs across websites

**Use Cases**:

- Find all websites using specific Google Analytics ID
- Discover sites using same advertising code
- Identify websites by technology footprint

**Example**:

```text
"UA-12345678" (Google Analytics ID)
"GTM-ABC123" (Google Tag Manager)
```

### Certificate Search (crt.sh)

**Purpose**: Search certificate transparency logs for SSL/TLS certificates

**Use Cases**:

- Subdomain enumeration
- Find all domains owned by organization
- Discover forgotten or test domains

**Example queries**:

```text
%.example.com
```

**URL**: <https://crt.sh/>

### Pastebin and Code Search

**GitHub Code Search**:

- Find leaked credentials in public repositories
- Discover API keys and tokens
- Identify technology stack from code

```text
org:company_name password
filename:.env DB_PASSWORD
```

**Pastebin Search** (<https://psbdmp.ws/>):

- Monitor pastes mentioning your organization
- Find leaked credentials or data
- Track data breaches

### Wayback Machine

**Internet Archive** (<https://archive.org/web/>):

- View historical versions of websites
- Recover deleted content
- Find old vulnerabilities or information

**Use Cases**:

- See old employee directories
- Find removed documentation
- Discover changed infrastructure

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

### Passive Nature

- Search engines for reconnaissance are generally passive
- You're querying a search engine, not the target directly
- Information is already publicly accessible

### Legal Gray Areas

- Accessing exposed data may still violate laws (CFAA in U.S.)
- Some jurisdictions consider accessing misconfigured systems illegal
- Terms of service violations can have legal consequences

### Responsible Use

1. **Don't access exposed systems**: Finding is reconnaissance; accessing is intrusion
2. **Responsible disclosure**: Report serious exposures to affected organizations
3. **Authorization required**: Only access systems you have permission to test
4. **Document findings**: Keep records of what you find and why

### Notification Dilemma

If you discover serious exposures (e.g., medical records, financial data):

- Consider responsible disclosure to organization
- May report to CERT/CC or similar organizations
- Balance risk of notification with risk of exposure
- Document decision-making process

## Defensive Measures

### Preventing Search Engine Exposure

**1. robots.txt Configuration**:

```text
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /config/
Disallow: /backup/
```

**Note**: robots.txt doesn't prevent crawling, only requests it

**2. Remove from Index**:

- Google Search Console: Request URL removal
- Meta tags: `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`
- X-Robots-Tag HTTP header

**3. Authentication and Access Controls**:

- Require authentication for sensitive areas
- Don't rely on "security through obscurity"
- Use proper access controls, not just hidden URLs

**4. Regular Monitoring**:

```text
site:yourcompany.com filetype:pdf confidential
site:yourcompany.com intitle:"index of"
```

**5. Information Disclosure Prevention**:

- Disable directory listing
- Remove verbose error messages
- Strip server version banners
- Don't expose internal file structures

### Shodan Protection

**1. Minimize Internet Exposure**:

- Only expose services that must be public
- Use VPN for administrative access
- Implement network segmentation

**2. Regular Shodan Audits**:

```bash
# Monitor your organization
shodan search 'org:"Your Company"'

# Monitor your IP ranges
shodan host YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
```

**3. Set Up Alerts**:

- Use Shodan monitoring service
- Alert on new exposed services
- Track changes in footprint

**4. Banner Modification**:

- Modify server banners to remove versions
- Use generic responses
- Don't advertise technology stack

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Google Dorking Challenge

**Objective**: Find sensitive information about a target organization (with permission)

1. Start with basic site search: `site:example.com`
2. Look for exposed directories: `site:example.com intitle:"index of"`
3. Find document types: `site:example.com (filetype:pdf OR filetype:xls OR filetype:doc)`
4. Search for login pages: `site:example.com (inurl:login OR inurl:admin)`
5. Look for technology indicators: `site:example.com "powered by"`

**Document**:

- What sensitive information did you find?
- What types of files are exposed?
- What technologies are in use?

### Exercise 2: Shodan Reconnaissance

**Objective**: Understand your organization's internet footprint

1. Search by organization name: `org:"Your Organization"`
2. Search by domain: `hostname:yourcompany.com`
3. Analyze exposed services and ports
4. Check for known vulnerabilities: `org:"Your Organization" vuln:*`
5. Document findings and risk assessment

### Exercise 3: Certificate Transparency

**Objective**: Enumerate subdomains via certificate logs

1. Visit <https://crt.sh>
2. Search for `%.example.com`
3. Compile list of discovered subdomains
4. Cross-reference with DNS enumeration results
5. Identify previously unknown assets

### Exercise 4: Self-OSINT via Search Engines

**Objective**: Understand what search engines reveal about you

1. Google your name in quotes with variations
2. Search your email address(es)
3. Search your username(s)
4. Check images (Google Images, your name)
5. Review what's accessible and consider privacy

## Integration with Reconnaissance Methodology

Search engine reconnaissance fits into the overall process:

1. **Passive Reconnaissance**: Search engines are passive, generate no target logs
2. **Early Phase**: Use before active scanning to understand scope
3. **Continuous**: Search engines index new content constantly
4. **Validation**: Confirm technical findings with search data
5. **Intelligence**: Combine with OSINT for comprehensive picture

## Key Takeaways

- Traditional search engines (Google, Bing) can reveal sensitive data through dorking
- Shodan and similar platforms index internet-connected devices and services
- Search engine reconnaissance is largely passive but incredibly effective
- Organizations must monitor their own search engine exposure
- Legal and ethical considerations apply even to public data
- Defensive reconnaissance helps organizations understand their attack surface

## Conclusion

Search engines have evolved into powerful reconnaissance tools that allow security professionals and attackers alike to discover vast amounts of information without directly interacting with targets. From Google dorking revealing misconfigured web servers to Shodan exposing critical infrastructure, these tools demonstrate that passive reconnaissance can be devastatingly effective. Organizations must adopt a defensive mindset by regularly auditing their search engine footprint and implementing controls to prevent sensitive information exposure. Remember: if a search engine can find it, so can an attacker—and unlike active reconnaissance, search engine queries leave no traces on your systems.
